üßë‚Äçüíº Example Questions & (Sample) Board Answers
1. Should I increase my allocation to US tech stocks in 2024?
Discussion Transcript:

Strategist: Given current macroeconomic trends, US tech stocks could benefit from anticipated interest rate cuts and continued digital adoption.
Technical: The NASDAQ recently broke key resistance levels, suggesting bullish momentum; however, RSI is approaching overbought territory.
Risk: Increasing tech exposure adds concentration risk. Consider balancing with defensive sectors to cushion volatility.
Platform Specialist: You might consider broad-based tech ETFs to diversify risk while maintaining exposure to the sector.
Final Recommendation:

The board consensus is cautiously optimistic. US tech stocks may perform well, but ensure portfolio diversification and consider using broad tech ETFs to manage risk.
2. Is it a good time to enter the gold market?
Discussion Transcript:

Strategist: Gold typically performs well during periods of geopolitical tension and inflation, both present in 2024.
Technical: Gold prices have formed a bullish cup-and-handle pattern, signaling upward potential.
Risk: Gold is less volatile but offers lower long-term growth. Limit allocation to avoid underperformance in strong equity years.
Platform Specialist: Consider using gold ETFs or established gold mining companies for exposure.
Final Recommendation:

The board recommends a moderate allocation to gold as a diversifier, given current macroeconomic conditions. ETFs are an accessible route.
3. How should I diversify my crypto portfolio?
Discussion Transcript:

Strategist: The crypto market remains volatile, with regulatory risks and potential for mainstream adoption.
Technical: Bitcoin and Ethereum are in uptrends, but alternative coins display mixed signals.
Risk: Crypto is highly speculative. A maximum 5-10% portfolio allocation is advised, spread across major coins.
Platform Specialist: Use reputable platforms' diversified crypto products, or build a basket with BTC, ETH, and select established altcoins.
Final Recommendation:

Diversify mainly among top cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH), with small positions in select altcoins. Limit overall exposure and consider diversified crypto products for simplicity.
4. What are the risks of investing in Chinese equities right now?
Discussion Transcript:

Strategist: China faces slow GDP growth and regulatory uncertainty, though long-term prospects remain.
Technical: Main indices exhibit downward trends, though some technical support levels are holding.
Risk: Political and currency risks are high, and volatility is expected to continue.
Platform Specialist: Use diversified China ETFs or global funds with limited China exposure to mitigate risk.
Final Recommendation:

Exercise caution with Chinese equities. Exposure should be limited and diversified via broad-market ETFs to mitigate heightened risk.
